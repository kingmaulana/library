- an array to store object of Books
- function with some argument in it -> return a new book to array


-Book object have property :
	-title
	-author
	-pages
	-read or not yet

-books = [] (empty array for store)

-function addBook (to create book object) :
	- param(title, author, pages, read)
	- books.push(new Book(all param))

(to show a book)
- set html for title first h1 or div
- get the html element h1

- function showBooks:
	-forEach bookCollection iterate :
		- select only the title
		- create element h1 within div
		- append child h1 to the div

- create a table for display :
	- select the table -> tbody
	- create element tr
	- create element th and td 3 times
	- append th, td inside the tr


- button add book : prevent the pages refresh automatic when click button

- form submit (make the input user as argument to the function addBook() :
	- make dom for all input form(using value to handle in script)
	- call addBook() then pass the param as argument
	- problem when click submit : (solve cuz i create element in forEach, just move out)
		- the display html keep create element
		- the display duplicate element already created before
		- wee need to remove old element and replace with new one


- add a button for each book in the table for delete them :
	- when add / submit button is clicked by user the book will show into the row
	- when that happen, not only the data will show but also the remove button :
		- create element button html in dom
		- display each side of row and create data-attribute for labeling
	- make a function to delete when button was clicked :
		- store all the delete button
		- iterate all the button
		- when the button clicked, show wich button was click
		- if button.reference is equal to object.title
		- delete that array :
			- find the index of array
			- splicec that index
